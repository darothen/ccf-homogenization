73-76   OBSERVATION TIMES (OT)
                     Precipitation OT
                     Temperature OT

               The observation times are encoded to the nearest whole hour where
               known; in some instances, the observation may have been taken at a
               variable hour (e.g., sunrise or sunset) or according to a rotating
               seasonal schedule based upon agricultural needs.

               Examples:
               01-24,99  Nearest Whole Hour; "99" for unknown
               SR        Sunrise
               SS        Sunset
               RS        Rotating Schedule (in general, evening observations were
                         taken during the winter months [Oct/Nov thru Apr/May] and
                         morning observations taken during summer months or
                         "crop season".)

                         In "RS" instances, often two observations were taken during
                         the summer; usually between 5-7 AM and again between 5-7
                         PM.  In such 2 obs/day instances, it's unclear whether both
                         elements are read twice, but recorded for a single hour; or
                         (a more likely practice), the precipitation is recorded in
                         the morning and temperature in the evening.

               At some sites (usually airports) a uniform schedule was in use, but
               the particular hour at which a particular element was observed was
               not specified.  In these instances, the number of hours per day for
               which observations were taken is given.  (NOTE:  the number of hours
               must not be confused with synoptic observing schedules such as
               3-hourly, 6-hourly, etc. ones at which observations are taken at
               intervals of every 3 hours, 6 hours, etc.)
 
               xxHR      where xx indicates the number of hours for which the site
                         took observations;

               An early practice regarding the observation times of temperature
               involved taking three readings (morning, afternoon, and evening or
               "tri-daily").  These readings were usually made at 7 AM, 2 PM, and
               9 PM.  A weighted average was computed in which the 9 PM observation
               was summed twice and the total sum divided by 4 [e.g.,
               (7 AM + 2 PM + 9 PM + 9 PM )/ 4  ].  Note, in these instances, no
               precipitation observation time has been encoded.

               TRID      indicates "tri-daily" temperature average


               The early editions of the Weather Bureau's reporting forms allowed
               space only for a single observing time to be entered.  Later on,
               revised forms specifically identified whether the observation time
               was for temperature or precipitation.  In the instances where the
               forms were ambiguous with regard to the observing times of these
               elements, the OT is encoded as follows:

               9xx9      where xx indicates the hour as listed for the observations;
                         whether it's accurate for both temperature and precipitation
                         is unknown

               Examples of OT codes:

               SRSS      Precipitation reading made at sunrise; temperature read at
                         sunset

               SS99      Precipitation read at sunset; temperature read at an
                         unknown hour or there is no temperature data available for
                         that period of record

               0718      Precipitation read at 0700 (i.e., 7 AM); temperature read
                         at 1800 (i.e., 6 PM)

               9079      Ambiguous form:  0700 was the only listed hour of
                         observation; unknown whether for both temperature and
                         precipitation

               06HR      Station observed 6 hours/day; whether the average of these
                         6 observations is what was recorded or only a single hour
                         was used is unclear

               RSSS      Precipitation readings made on a rotating schedule;
                         temperatures read at sunset

               TRID      "Tri-daily" readings of temperature; no OT encoded for
                         precipitation

               9918      Precipitation readings made at an unknown hour or there is
                         no precipitation data available for that period of record;
                         temperature read at 1800
